Contango Project

Project Summary 

Contango is an open source Arbitrage trading bot which trades on OKcoin.com futures and spot bitcoin markets. Contango checks the the premium cost on bitcoin futures contracts compared to the spot price and executes inverse trades accordingly in order to arbitrage the premium between the two instruments. Contango uses RestSDK to connect with OKcoinâ€™s api and execute trades quickly.
